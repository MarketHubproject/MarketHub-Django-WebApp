  - **Products App (10 tests):** Product model with validation and integration tests
- **All tests passing** with 100% success rate
- **Test types:** Unit tests, integration tests, API tests, model tests

### 2. Database Migrations
- **Verified migration status:** All migrations up to date
- **No pending migrations** required for current models
- **Migration files verified:**
  - Homepage: 6 migration files (including Category, HeroSlide, Promotion models)
  - Products: 3 migration files (Product model with category field)
  - Accounts: Standard Django auth migrations
- **Database integrity confirmed** through system checks

### 3. Fixtures Creation and Management
- **Created comprehensive fixtures** with sample data:
  - `users.json` - Sample users including admin
  - `categories.json` - Featured categories (Electronics, Fashion, Books, etc.)
  - `products.json` - Sample products across all categories
  - `hero_slides.json` - Homepage carousel slides
  - `promotions.json` - Active promotional content
  - `carts.json` - Sample shopping cart data
- **Sample data script** (`create_sample_data.py`) for generating test data
- **Fixture validation** and loading procedures tested

### 4. Deployment Strategy
- **Comprehensive deployment script** (`deploy.py`) supporting:
  - **Staging environment** deployment
  - **Production environment** deployment
  - **Automated backup** creation before deployment
  - **Rollback capabilities** with one-command recovery
  - **Health checks** and system verification
  - **Service management** (nginx, gunicorn, etc.)

### 5. Rollback Plan
- **Automated rollback system:**
  - Database backup and restore
  - Code version rollback via Git commits
  - Media files backup/restore
  - Service restart procedures
- **Backup retention strategy**
- **Emergency recovery procedures**
- **One-command rollback:** `python deploy.py --rollback [backup_path]`

### 6. Documentation
- **Complete deployment guide** (`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`) with:
  - Step-by-step deployment procedures
  - Rollback instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Security considerations
  - Emergency contacts and procedures

### 7. Quality Assurance Workflow
- **Automated QA script** (`run_qa_workflow.py`) that performs:
  - Complete test suite execution
  - Migration verification
  - Fixture validation
  - Database connectivity testing
  - Model functionality verification
  - API endpoint testing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - System health checks

## üìä Test Results Summary

```
Found 50 test(s).
