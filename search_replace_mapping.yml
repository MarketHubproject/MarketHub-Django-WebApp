  recommended_order:
    - "1. Apply special_cases first (exact matches)"
    - "2. Apply context_specific mappings"
    - "3. Apply regex_patterns with word boundaries"
    - "4. Apply text_mappings for remaining cases"
    - "5. Manual review of results"

  cautions:
    - "Always backup files before applying changes"
    - "Test regex patterns on sample data first"
    - "Review file renames carefully"
    - "Check for broken links after URL changes"
    - "Validate CSS/SCSS after variable renames"
    - "Update import statements and references"
